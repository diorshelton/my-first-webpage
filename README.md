## Description

_This is the very first webpage I created using Epicodus. It is a learning exercise that has helped me practice html basics like inline elements and block elements. It has also allowed me to gain familiarity with Git, Github and command line interface. In creating this webpage I have gained some basic knowledge of a few basic skills that are important to web development._
